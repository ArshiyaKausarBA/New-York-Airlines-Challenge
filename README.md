## :feet: Steps



- Data download from Kaggle.
- Connected to Tableau.
- Performed data analysis on imported data.
- Designed dashboards for Traffic trends, and delay trends, and built a storyboard to show the impact of delay and performance.




## :bulb: Insights

 📍Traffic has increased at the end of the year.
 📍Most popular day is Monday, date is the 18th, month is July, and the hour is 8 a.m.
 📍So, most delay has occurred in July due to traffic.
 📍The least number of flights are taken from LGA.
 📍Because 5 out of 6 most delayed Airlines are from LGA.
 📍Frontier is the airline that Airline provides the most delayed service.
 📍From LGA origin, LGA-BOS is the 3rd most popular route but with negative delay.
 📍Because only one Airline is used- US Airway Inc
 📍It's not the airport that is causing the delay, it's the airlines.
 📍Stop using those 5 airlines in LGA until they fix their performance.
