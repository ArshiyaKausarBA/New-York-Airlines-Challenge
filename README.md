# :airplane: New-York-Airlines-Delay



## :books: About the Data

- The dataset contains data on nearly **336K** airline flight takeoffs, their details like Air-time and Distance and their arrival and departure delays, how many minutes the flights were delayed etc.

## :dart: Objective

The aim of this project is to analyze the performance of airlines in 2013 and to uncover insights that can minimize the rate of delays. Thus, improving airports' performance.

## :feet: Steps



- Data downloaded from Kaggle.
- Connected to Tableau.
- Performed data analysis on imported data.
- Designed dashboards for Traffic trends, and delay trends, and built a storyboard to show the impact of delay and performance.




## :bulb: Insights

 
📍 Traffic has increased at the end of the year.<br> 

📍 Most popular day is Monday, date is the 18th, month is July, and the hour is 8 a.m.<br> 

📍 Hence, most delays have occurred in July due to traffic.<br> 

📍 The least number of flights are taken from LGA. Because 5 out of 6 most delayed Airlines are from LGA.<br>

📍 Frontier is the Airline that provides the most delayed service.<br> 

📍 From LGA origin, LGA-BOS is the 3rd most popular route but with negative delay.<br> 

📍 Because only one Airline is used- US Airway Inc.<br> 

📍 It's not the Airport that is causing the delay, it's the Airlines.<br> 

📍 Stop using those 5 airlines in LGA until they fix their performance.<br> 

📍 Reduce diversions and use other airlines that have an average zero delay.
